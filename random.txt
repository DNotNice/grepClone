Hello
This was a perfect tutorial. Seriously, this is how you do it.
I know zero Rust.
But I mostly understood the original code well enough based on knowing things like Powershell and Bash.
Then, even though I didn't understand much of the tweaks you made,
I understood why you were making them and I have no doubt that reading the book would clarify what you did.
But the real key to what makes this a phenomenal tutorial is that it is simple enough to be accessible to newcomers while still being something useful.
I could easily see myself using this tool as part of a larger program I want to build.
All I'd need to add is whatever it takes to decompress/decode the files I need to read and then a bit of code to manipulate those files and their contents.
Libraries exist to handle the former, I just have to find them and port them to Rust.
The latter is probably fairly trivial hello.
Bottom line is that you showed me a beginner project that actually leads to something.
And that is how you motivate people to learn.
